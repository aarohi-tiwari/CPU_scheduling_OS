CPU Scheduling Simulation
Overview
This project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms to understand and analyze their behavior. It allows users to input process details and choose from different algorithms to calculate scheduling parameters such as completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time.

Features
Supports the following scheduling algorithms:
First Come First Serve (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF - Non-Preemptive)
Shortest Remaining Time (SRT - Preemptive)
Round Robin (RR)
Priority-Based Scheduling
Multi-Level Queue (MLQ) Scheduling
Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling
Computes essential metrics:
Completion Time
Turnaround Time
Waiting Time
Allows interactive input for process details and algorithm selection.
